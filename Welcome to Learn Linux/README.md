Welcome to Learn Linux
Welcome to "Learn Linux"! Admittedly, the course name is a bit of a misnomer. It's called "Learn Linux" because "Linux" is what most students think of regarding the concepts in this course. A more accurate title might be "Learn to use shells and terminals in a Unix-like environment", but that's a mouthful.

Learning Goals
Understand the difference between a shell and a terminal
Learn how to navigate and use the file system using the command line
Learn how to install software using the command line
Understand how to manage your PATH and environment variables
Learn how to manage permissions and execute programs
This course will get you comfortable working on a command line, which is a skill that's going to be critical for the rest of your career as a programmer. So, instead of writing code in the browser, in this course you'll interact with a command line interface (CLI) directly on your machine.

Assignment
Find and open a terminal on your computer (see below for instructions).
Type the following command and press enter:
echo "Hello world"

When you're done, answer the question.
