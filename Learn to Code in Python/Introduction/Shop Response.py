Shop Response
Our dev team has been making updates to Fantasy Quest's innkeeper shop, but there's a problem! The Innkeeper's dialogue is blank!

Assignment
Add 2 separate print statements to complete the Innkeeper's response. They should output the following to the console in that order:

The Innkeeper: Ah! Great choices...
The Innkeeper: Is there anything else I can help you with?
"""

print("The Innkeeper: Ah! Great choices...")
print("The Innkeeper: Is there anything else I can help you with?")
