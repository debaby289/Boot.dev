None Return
When no return value is specified in a function, it will automatically return None. For example, maybe it's a function that prints some text to the console, but doesn't explicitly return a value. The following code snippets all return the same value, None:
"""

def my_func():
    print("I do nothing")
    return None

def my_func():
    print("I do nothing")
    return

def my_func():
    print("I do nothing")
